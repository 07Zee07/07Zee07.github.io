      <h1 class="procopius">Animi Meditation Energie Massage Therapy</h1>
      <h2 class="procopius" style="color:red">The Animi Beauty System® as a technique</h2>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.animibeautysystem.eu">Animi Beauty System</a> is not yoga, not meditation, not a
        relaxation technique. It is rather a technique to tune ourselves either when we are awake and conscious or when
        we are less awake. Possessing it makes us cheerful, calm and well-balanced and we are ready for any change. As a
        result you will realize that you actually have a huge role in your own feelings, the happenings of your life and
        the forming of your environment. You will not only realize it, but you will be able to make good use of it:
        Through yourself you can produce an effect on them.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.animibeautysystem.eu">Animi Beauty System</a> is very complex and diverse even though
        it is very simple. That makes it possible for everybody – just like you – to find themselves, their harmony and
        their own way. The Animi is in you either you see the world rationally or spiritually.</p>

      <h2 class="procopius" style="color:red">The Animi Beauty System® as a state</h2>
      <p>The Animi means ‘at heart’. During our Animi treatments everyone can experience the harmony and peace at heart.
        I first discovered this mental state in myself. Later I tried to call it consciously forth: it is a very happy
        feeling when you feel that ‘All is very well’, you are balanced with yourself and in harmony with the World. The
        chaotic conditions of the outer world won’t put an effect on you even if you are aware of their existence, you
        feel whole. That is what we call Animi.</p>
      <p>As a practicing Animi Soul-Beautician I help you from my heart. Intuitions and intimations lead me to the state
        of Animi. This is the soul and essence of the <a href="http://www.animibeautysystem.eu">Animi Beauty System</a>:
        ‘You discover this feeling at your heart and experience its beneficial, healing, harmonizing, balancing power
        and we will teach you to easily get there anytime you wish.’ /Kriszta Halász/</p>

      <h2 class="procopius" style="color:red">The Animi Beauty System® as an approach</h2>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.animibeautysystem.eu">Animi Beauty System</a>’s approach alloys some elements from the
        buddhism, Ayurveda, homeopathy, Feng Shui, Yoga Nidra. In spite of this, it gets along with our own religion and
        belief. It draws from the different psychological schools, such as psychoanalysis, individual psychology,
        transpersonal psychology, brain control, psycho-cybernetics, neuro linguistic programming, autogenic training,
        transactional analysis on the spiritual ground of mental hygienic and pedagogical knowledge and Hermes thesis.
      </p>
      <p>Every area has its own big masters, from whom it is worth learning. The above listing is for those who are
        interested in the source. ‘With time they will experience that the essence is the same just the way towards it
        is different. From the above mentioned areas in the past twenty years I have collected piece by piece the
        essence, the wisdom which I can use efficiently as a beautician. Because the beauty care is what I can do best.
        As I have been instilling this knowledge into my profession and everyday work for twenty years my practical
        experience has kept increasing greatly. I have become a soul-beautician without realizing it. Nowadays I create
        my own Animi treatments. ‘ /Kriszta Halász/</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.animibeautysystem.eu">Animi Beauty System</a> opens new perspectives in the field of
        selfness and mindness services using the <a href="http://www.animibeautysystem.eu">Animi Beauty System</a>’s
        know-how and the Colour Energy Ritual which was further developed on its grounds. It provides beauticians and
        experienced psychotherapists and spiritual healers with trainings and possibility for business cooperation. With
        this new approach it contributes to the success of the above mentioned professionals.</p>
      <p>Every beautician needs to be some kind of psychologist as the guests visit her partly to relax, forget about
        their everyday problems and refresh. The syllabus of the <a href="http://www.animibeautysystem.eu">Animi Beauty
          System</a>® and the Colour-Energy Ritual perfectly covers the knowledge and practical methods needed for that.
      </p>
      <p>This method was elaborated by a highly qualified and recognized expert, teacher, examiner and active beautician
        master who has been running her own successful beauty business for twenty years. It is a reputable beauty salon
        with beautician education and training, beauty product wholesale and retail, and authorized dealing of
        professional brands.</p>
      <p>She obtained her degree at the University of Debrecen and wrote her thesis about the relations between the skin
        and the soul in 1999. As part of her scientific activity she gave presentations at the First National
        Dermatologist and Beautician Congress (with the title: ‘Mental Hygiene – the Bridge between the Dermatologist
        and the Beautician’), at the First National Mental Hygiene Congress (titled: ‘Mental Hygiene in the Beauty
        Care’) and in October, 2012 at the Traveling Assembly of the Relaxation and Symbol Therapeutic National
        Association she gave a speech on Beautifying and Developing the Soul with Animi Soul Cosmetology®.</p>
      <p>Her profession is continuously motivated by the beauty care and the psychology. In February, 2011 her
        methodology which is based on a 20-year experience was patent protected as <a
          href="http://www.animibeautysystem.eu">Animi Beauty System</a>®. The Animi Accredited Education Centre at the
        heart of Debrecen passes on her knowledge in the form of Animi Make-up, Animi Soul Beautician trainings. For our
        franchise partners there are <a href="http://www.animibeautysystem.eu">Animi Beauty System</a> Soul Beautician
        and Animi Beauty System Soul Beautician Master trainings. We provide other professionals in the field of
        soulhealing with Colour-Energy Mentor trainings.</p>
