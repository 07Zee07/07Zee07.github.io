                    <li>Rinse the cashews under cold running water and drain. Place in a bowl and pour over
                        enough
                        water to cover, then set aside and soak overnight. Drain well.</li>
                    <li>Heat the macadamia oil in a large saucepan over medium–high heat. Add the onion and
                        ginger
                        and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the onion softens. Add the cashews, carrots and 6
                        cups
                        water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium–low and simmer, uncovered, for
                        about
                        15 minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Stir in the cayenne pepper, then remove
                        from
                        the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the soup to a food processor or blender and process, in batches, until smooth.
                        Return
                        the
                        soup to the pan over medium heat until heated through. Serve topped with the coriander

                <ol>
                    <li>A mushroom risotto can be taken in many different ways, depending on what kind of
                        mushrooms
                        you have and whether they are introduced at the very beginning of cooking or just added
                        at
                        the end, as I’m going to do here. The inspiration for this recipe came when I was in
                        Japan
                        and saw mushrooms being cooked completely dry on a barbecue or griddle pan. This way of
                        cooking brings out a really fresh and nutty flavour in them; perfect for being dressed
                        lightly with olive oil, salt and lemon juice or stirred into a risotto at the last
                        minute
                        before serving.</li>
                    <li>Heat your stock in a saucepan and keep it on a low simmer. Place the porcini mushrooms
                        in
                        a bowl and pour in just enough hot stock to cover. Leave for a couple of minutes until
                        they’ve
                        softened. Fish them out of the stock and chop them, reserving the soaking liquid.</li>
                    <li>In a large pan, heat a lug of olive oil and add the onion and celery. Slowly fry without
                        colouring them for at least 10 minutes, then turn the heat up and add the rice. Give it
                        a
                        stir.
                        Stir in the vermouth or wine – it’ll smell fantastic! Keep stirring until the liquid has
                        cooked into the rice. Now pour the porcini soaking liquid through a sieve into the pan
                        and
                        add the chopped porcini, a good pinch of salt and your first ladle of hot stock. Turn
                        the
                        heat down to a simmer and keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the
                        starch
                        out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next.</li>
                    <li>Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. This will take
                        about
                        30 minutes. Meanwhile, get a dry griddle pan hot and grill the wild mushrooms until
                        soft.
                        If your pan isn’t big enough, do this in batches. Put them into a bowl and add the
                        chopped
                        herbs, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice. Using your hands, get stuck in and toss
                        everything
                        together – this is going to be incredible!</li>
                    <li>Take the risotto off the heat and check the seasoning carefully. Stir in the butter and
                        the
                        Parmesan. You want it to be creamy and oozy in texture, so add a bit more stock if you
                        think
                        it needs it. Put a lid on and leave the risotto to relax for about 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Take your risotto and add a little more seasoning or Parmesan if you like. Serve a good
                        dollop
                        of risotto topped with some grilled dressed mushrooms, a sprinkling of freshly grated
                        Parmesan
                        and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</li>

                    <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C. Lightly grease and base line a 9 inch (23 cm) deep
                        round
                        cake tin with greased greaseproof paper.</li>
                    <li>Measure the margarine, sugar, eggs, chopped walnuts, sultanas, flour and baking powder
                        into a large bowl and beat well for about 2 minutes until thoroughly blended.</li>
                    <li>Spoon half the mixture into the prepared tin then spread the grated apple and ground
                        cinnamon
                        in an even layer on top. (I fancied a nice layer of apple so I thinly sliced the apple
                        instead of grating it, but its down to personal preference)</li>
                    <li>Spread the remaining cake mixture on top, level the surface then sprinkle generously
                        with
                        light muscovado sugar and walnuts.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the pre-heated oven for about 1 1/4 – 1 1/2 hours or until the cake is well
                        risen
                        and golden brown (mine was cooked after 1 hour).</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes before turning out
                        and
                        leaving to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
                    <li>Dust with icing sugar to serve.</li>
