                    <ol>
                        <li>A mushroom risotto can be taken in many different ways, depending on what kind of
                            mushrooms
                            you have and whether they are introduced at the very beginning of cooking or just added
                            at
                            the end, as I’m going to do here. The inspiration for this recipe came when I was in
                            Japan
                            and saw mushrooms being cooked completely dry on a barbecue or griddle pan. This way of
                            cooking brings out a really fresh and nutty flavour in them; perfect for being dressed
                            lightly with olive oil, salt and lemon juice or stirred into a risotto at the last
                            minute
                            before serving.</li>
                        <li>Heat your stock in a saucepan and keep it on a low simmer. Place the porcini mushrooms
                            in
                            a bowl and pour in just enough hot stock to cover. Leave for a couple of minutes until
                            they’ve
                            softened. Fish them out of the stock and chop them, reserving the soaking liquid.</li>
                        <li>In a large pan, heat a lug of olive oil and add the onion and celery. Slowly fry without
                            colouring them for at least 10 minutes, then turn the heat up and add the rice. Give it
                            a
                            stir.
                            Stir in the vermouth or wine – it’ll smell fantastic! Keep stirring until the liquid has
                            cooked into the rice. Now pour the porcini soaking liquid through a sieve into the pan
                            and
                            add the chopped porcini, a good pinch of salt and your first ladle of hot stock. Turn
                            the
                            heat down to a simmer and keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the
                            starch
                            out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next.</li>
                        <li>Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. This will take
                            about
                            30 minutes. Meanwhile, get a dry griddle pan hot and grill the wild mushrooms until
                            soft.
                            If your pan isn’t big enough, do this in batches. Put them into a bowl and add the
                            chopped
                            herbs, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice. Using your hands, get stuck in and toss
                            everything
                            together – this is going to be incredible!</li>
                        <li>Take the risotto off the heat and check the seasoning carefully. Stir in the butter and
                            the
                            Parmesan. You want it to be creamy and oozy in texture, so add a bit more stock if you
                            think
                            it needs it. Put a lid on and leave the risotto to relax for about 3 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Take your risotto and add a little more seasoning or Parmesan if you like. Serve a good
                            dollop
                            of risotto topped with some grilled dressed mushrooms, a sprinkling of freshly grated
                            Parmesan
                            and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</li>

                        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C. Lightly grease and base line a 9 inch (23 cm) deep
                            round
                            cake tin with greased greaseproof paper.</li>

                            in an even layer on top. (I fancied a nice layer of apple so I thinly sliced the apple
                            instead of grating it, but its down to personal preference)</li>
                        <li>Spread the remaining cake mixture on top, level the surface then sprinkle generously

                            risen
                            and golden brown (mine was cooked after 1 hour).</li>
                        <li>Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes before turning out
                            and

                        <li>Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Butter both sides of each slice of bread,
                            then cut a large heart (or circle) out of the centre of one slice using a knife or biscuit
                            cutter. Place the slices of bread, including the cut-out piece, into the frying pan and
                            cook for 2 mins until golden. While the bread is cooking, slice the avocado and squeeze
                            over the lemon juice. Toss the watercress in a little lemon juice, too.</li>
                        <li>Flip the bread over, then crack the egg into the cut-out hole. After 1-2 mins, the whole
                            slice of bread and cut-out piece should be golden brown on both sides. Transfer to a plate
                            (eat the cut-out as a chef’s perk, if you like!). Cover the pan with a lid, or some foil,
                            and lower the heat. Continue cooking for a further 1-2 mins until the egg is done to your
                            liking.</li>
                        <li>Top the toasted slice of bread with the avocado, smoked salmon and watercress, and season
                            with a twist of pepper. Put the egg-in-the-hole slice on top and serve with an extra wedge
                            of lemon, if you like.</li>

                            just tender. Drain well and leave in the colander to steam-dry.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, spray an ovenproof pan with cooking spray. Add the leeks with a splash of water
                            and fry until very soft and squishy. Add a few more sprays of the oil, tip in the potatoes
                            along with the ham, and fry to crisp up a little. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.</li>
                        <li>Stir in the mustard, 1 egg and a good amount of seasoning with a fork – break up some of
                            the potatoes roughly as you do. Flatten down the mixture, spray the top with oil, and bake
                            in the oven for 15-20 mins until the top is crisp.</li>
                        <li>When the hash is nearly ready, heat 200ml water in a non-stick frying pan with a lid (or
                            use a baking sheet as a lid). When it is steaming (but before it simmers), crack in the
                            remaining 4 eggs and cover with a lid. Cook for 2-4 mins until the eggs are done to your
                            liking. Meanwhile, heat the beans.</li>
                        <li>Lift an egg onto each plate, add a big scoop of hash and spoon on some beans.</li>

                            carrots, 140g split red lentils, 1l hot vegetable stock and 125ml milk to the pan and bring
                            to the boil. </li>
                        <li>Simmer for 15 mins until the lentils have swollen and softened.</li>
                        <li>Whizz the soup with a stick blender or in a food processor until smooth (or leave it chunky
                            if
                            you prefer).</li>
                        <li>Season to taste and finish with a dollop of plain yogurt and a sprinkling of the reserved
                            toasted spices.
                            Serve with warmed naan breads.</li>

                        <li>1 whole chicken, about 1.5 kg, cut into parts</li>
                        <li>about 2.5 liter cold water</li>
                        <li>3-4 medium carrots</li>

                        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
                        <li>1 bunch of fresh parsley (plus more, chopped for serving)</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Place a large pot with about 2.5 liter cold water on medium heat and add the chicken pieces
                            (legs, breast, wings legs and back – cut into half).</li>
                        <li>Let it cook on medium-low heat until some foam appears on the surface.</li>
                        <li>Skim the foam off with a ladle or you can use a strainer too.</li>
                        <li>Continue to cook the soup on medium-low heat, uncovered.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile peel all the vegetables. I usually leave some skin on the onion – it gives a nice
                            golden color to the soup.</li>
                        <li>Cut the carrots and parsley root in half, then halve them again lengthwise. (no need to
                            halve
                            the thinner ends). Cut the celery root in half and quarter the kohlrabi.</li>
                        <li>Put all the vegetables (carrots, parsley roots, kohlrabi, celery root, onion, garlic cloves,
                            cauliflower florets, savoy cabbage leaves and a bunch of parsley) into the soup. For more
                            flavour add one tomato and a green (hot) pepper too.</li>
                        <li>Season the soup with salt, black peppercorns and a little bit of paprika.</li>
                        <li>Bring the soup to a boil then cook on low heat, uncovered for about 2 hours.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile cook the vermicelli egg noodles (or other kind of soup pasta) in boiling salted
                            water – according to the packet instruction. Then drain and rinse with cold water to prevent
                            sticking. Put it into a bow and set aside.</li>
                        <li>After about 2 hours of cooking remove the pot from the heat. Discard the vegetables you're
                            not going to eat (e.g.: savoy cabbage leaves, celery root, onion, tomato, green pepper,
                            parsley).</li>
                        <li>Carefully remove the remaining vegetables which will be served with the soup.</li>
                        <li>Remove the chicken pieces too and place them into a separate bowl.</li>
                        <li>Put a sieve over a pot and place a cheesecloth into it. Ladle the broth through it, then
                            remove the sieve with the cheesecloth – now, you have a clean, golden soup, which is ready
                            to serve.</li>
                        <li>ut some chicken meat, vegetables and noodles into a bowl and ladle some hot soup over it.
                            Sprinkle with chopped parsley and season with freshly ground black pepper. (you can also add
                            some dried hot chili to the soup – if you prefer.)</li>

                        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7. Cut the aubergine[s] into quarters
                            lengthways, then slice into big pieces. Rub the chopped aubergine with a drizzle of olive
                            oil and the ground cumin, then season generously with salt</li>
                        <li>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high
                            heat. Once hot,
                            add the aubergine and cook for 1 min each side or until browned. Transfer the browned
                            aubergine
                            to a baking
                            tray (use tin foil to avoid mess) and put it in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked

                            (reserve the

                        <li>While the aubergine is cooking, boil a kettle. Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic.

                            the
                            ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate). Peel and dice the
                            red
                            onion[s]</li>
                        <li>Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Once hot, add the diced onion

                            a pinch
                            of salt. Cook for 5 min or until softened. Add the chopped ginger and garlic and the curry
                            powder and
                            cook for a further 3 min</li>
                        <li>Rinse the red lentils in a sieve under the cold tap. Add the red lentils and canned lentils
                            (no
                            need to drain)
                            to the softened onion. Dissolve the vegetable stock cube[s] in 350 ml [550 ml] boiled water.
                            Add
                            the stock to
                            the lentils and stir for 10-15 min or until all the water is absorbed and the lentils are
                            tender
                            and porridge-like

                        <li>Once the lentils are cooked, remove them from the heat and stir in 2/3 of the coconut
                            yoghurt
                            and 2/3 of the chopped
                            coriander (you'll use the rest for garnish) – this is your two-lentil dal. Season generously
                            with salt and pepper.
                            Serve the two-lentil dal in bowls and top with the spiced aubergine. Garnish with the

                    <ol>
                        <li>Peel and finely dice the red onion. Cut the cauliflower into small florets. Heat a large,
                            wide-based pan
                            (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with 2 tbsp vegetable oil over a high heat.</li>
                        <li>Once the pan is hot, add the diced onion, cauliflower, curry powder and a pinch of salt and
                            pepper. Cook for
                            5 min or until starting to soften.</li>
                        <li>Crumble the vegetable stock cube into the pan and add the tomato paste. Tip: Add a drizzle
                            of
                            oil if the pan
                            looks a little dry</li>
                        <li>Cook for a further 2 min or until the cauliflower is starting to colour. Transfer the
                            contents
                            of the pan to a
                            bowl and set aside (reserve the pan for later) – this is your cauliflower mixture</li>
                        <li>Return the reserved pan to a high heat, add the basmati rice and stir to coat the grains in
                            the
                            remaining oil.
                            Add 350ml water and bring to the boil over a high heat. Meanwhile, cut the green beans in
                            half.
                        </li>
                        <li>Return the cauliflower mixture back to the pan. Add the green beans and sultanas.</li>
                        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered for 10-12 min or until the water has
                            absorbed
                            and the rice is
                            cooked – this is your vegetable biryani. Tip: Add a little water if the rice is not cooked
                            or
                            the mixture is
                            looking a little dry. Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks.</li>
                        <li>Check that the rice is tender, then taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if
                            needed.
                            Serve the vegetable
                            biryani with a dollop of coconut yoghurt and garnish with the chopped coriander.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7. Heat a large, wide-based pan
                            (preferably
                            non-stick) with
                            a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat. Rip the focaccia into rough bite-sized pieces.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add the ripped focaccia to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt.
                            Put
                            the tray in the oven
                            for 5-6 min or until lightly crisp – these are your focaccia croutons.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, crumble the chestnut mushrooms into the pan. Season with a pinch of salt and
                            pepper
                            and cook for 5 min
                            or until golden and softened – these are your caramelised mushrooms. Tip: Try not to stir
                            the
                            mushrooms too often,
                            as this will stop them from caramelising!</li>
                        <li>While the chestnut mushrooms soften, chop the basil finely, including the stalks.</li>
                        <li>Combine the chopped basil with the Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, 3 tbsp olive oil and 2
                            tbsp cold water. Season
                            with a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar and stir it all together – this is your basil
                            dressing
                        </li>
                        <li>Crumble the goats' cheese into rough bite-sized pieces.</li>
                        <li>Serve the focaccia croutons, caramelised mushrooms and crumbled goats' cheese over the baby
                            leaf
                            salad. Drizzle over
                            the basil dressing and let everyone dig in.</li>

                        <li>Preheat the grill to a high heat, then boil a kettle. Rip the portobello and chestnut
                            mushrooms into bite-sized
                            pieces onto a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil then season generously with salt and
                            pepper. Put the tray directly
                            under the grill and cook for 12-15 min or until they're nicely caramelised</li>
                        <li>Add the 3 seed mix to a large pot over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min or until toasted.
                            Once toasted, set aside on
                            a plate and keep the pot for later</li>
                        <li>Return the pot to a high heat. Add the linguine with plenty of boiled water with a pinch of
                            salt, bring to the boil
                            over a high heat and cook for 8-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite. Once cooked,
                            drain and reserve a cup of
                            the starchy cooking water</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic. Chop the basil finely, including the
                            stalks. Grate the cheddar
                            cheese finely </li>
                        <li>Grind the chopped basil, chopped garlic and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a
                            smooth paste. Add 2-3 tbsp
                            olive oil and mix well. Tip: if you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop the basil very
                            finely, then mix with olive oil.</li>
                        <li>Add the grated cheese to the basil with 2-3 tbsp olive oil. Season with a generous pinch of
                            salt and pepper and mix
                            thoroughly – this is your pesto</li>
                        <li>Return the drained linguine to the pot with a splash of your reserved starchy cooking water.
                            Stir the pesto and half
                            of the caramelised mushrooms through and cook for 1 min or until the pesto has coated the
                            pasta and the cheese has
                            melted. Top with the remaining caramelised mushrooms</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>2 sea bass, 1.25 kg in total (or use 4 small ones, about 300 g each), scaled and cleaned
                        </li>
                        <li>2 small fennel bulbs, fronds reserved</li>
                        <li>3 tbsp small capers, drained and rinsed</li>
                        <li>1 lemon, sliced</li>
                        <li>2 dill sprigs</li>
                        <li>25 g butter</li>
                        <li>olive oil</li>
                        <li>100 ml white wine</li>
                        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6.</li>
                        <li>Season the fish really well inside and out. Finely slice the fennel and place, along with
                            some fronds, inside
                            the sea bass stomach cavity. Sprinkle in the capers and line the lemon slices on top of the
                            fennel inside the cavity.
                            Top with the dill and dot over the butter in small pieces.</li>
                        <li>Drizzle the fish with a little olive oil and then wrap in foil. Pour the wine into the
                            parcel just before you close
                            up the last corner and make sure the parcel is well sealed, wrapping it in a second piece of
                            foil if necessary.</li>
                        <li>Place the parcel on a roasting tray and bake in the oven – about 20 minutes for the 600 g
                            fish, or 8–10 minutes if
                            using the smaller ones – until the fish is just cooked through with the flesh flaking away
                            from the bone.</li>
                        <li>Remove from the oven and leave to rest for a few minutes before serving (be careful of the
                            hot steam when you unwrap
                            the foil). Serve sprinkled with the reserved fennel fronds.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Put the lentils into a large saucepan along with the bay leaf, thyme and stock (or water).
                            Bring to the boil over
                            a medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 15–20 minutes until tender.</li>
                        <li>In the meantime, heat a large heavy-based frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the
                            olive oil. Once hot, add
                            the mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook in the pan for 6–8 minutes, stirring now and
                            again, until soft and lightly
                            caramelized on the edges.</li>
                        <li>Add the chopped garlic and continue to cook for 2 minutes, then remove the pan from the
                            heat.</li>
                        <li>Once the lentils are tender, drain well and discard the herbs. Put the lentils into a large
                            mixing bowl and add the
                            mushrooms. Mix together gently to avoid breaking up the lentils too much.</li>
                        <li>To make the dressing, put all the ingredients into a clean jam jar with a pinch of salt and
                            pepper. Close the lid of
                            the jar and shake until the dressing comes together and emulsifies.</li>
                        <li>Preheat the grill to high. Grill the salmon for 6–8 minutes to your liking.</li>
                        <li>Pour half the dressing over the warm lentils and toss gently to ensure everything is coated.
                            Fold in the rocket,
                            place the salmon on top and pour over the remaining dressing. Serve immediately.</li>
