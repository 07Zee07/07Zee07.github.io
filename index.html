        <p>"Sparks fly with Jason Carroll's 59 in electric stunter. Live Wire.</p>
        <p>FROM the outset, Live Wire was designed to be aerobatic, yet it had to be easy to fly and with a good
            glide
            performance. In this last respect it would make an excellent aileron trainer, and a quiet one too!</p>
        <div class="tip tip-right">
            <p>This is a song by
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MkwSrDNabQ" target="blank">Roupa Nova</a>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>There is no need for expensive motors or mini radio. Indeed, the prototype flies extremely well with a
            Graupner Speed 600 motor and an 8 x 4.5 folding prop, costing in all no more than Â£14 or so. As for
            nicads,
            I strongly recommend Sanyo SCR cells. Performance otherwise may be disappointing.</p>
        <p>So - if smooth, silent aerobatics take your fancy, let's get cracking!</p>
        <p>First the fuselage: Select two firm sheets of similar-grade 1/8 balsa for the fuselage sides. Spot glue
            the
            sheets together and cut them as one, to give identical components. Now draw onto the sides (one left,
            one
            right!) the position of formers and floor support rails. Next glue the 1/2 in and 3/8 in triangular
            lengths
            to each side.</p>
        <p>Formers F2 to F5 are cut from Lite-Ply. Cut F1 from birch ply, for this has to take the weight and torque
            of
            the motor. Glue F2 and F3 in position on one side using a set-square to ensure accuracy. F4 and F5 are
            next.
            Note the angles on the top, plan view.</p>
        <p>Add wing seat doublers and 3/16 rails, followed by the elevator snake 'outer'. At this stage you may wish
            to
            fit a second snake tube for the receiver aerial.</p>

        <p>Now glue the sides together at F2 and F3, trapping the Lite-Ply sheet floor between them. Don't forget
            this,
            as it will be impossible to fit later. Fix F1 in place with plenty of adhesive; pull the fuselage in at
            the
            nose, check for accuracy and hold together with clamps or rubber bands until the glue is dry. Now join
            the
            fuselage at the tail, gluing F4 and F5. Top and bottom fuselage sheeting is fitted with the grain
            running
            lengthways. Add the 1/8 sheet tailplane seat.</p>
        <p>This is the time to transform the box in front of you into a smooth, sleek fuselage. The cross-sections
            on
            the plan show how. Templates will help. Be careful to not remove too much balsa as this will weaken the
            structure.</p>
        <p>Face F1 with 1/8 sheet and F2 with the 1/32 ply wing peg support. Don't omit these as much strength is
            added.

            you
            to change packs very swiftly indeed. Finally, glue the wing bolt shear plate under the wing seating. The
            holes for the nuts will be drilled later..."</p>

            Lil'
            Eaglet, by Bob Aberle.</p>
        <p>During the past year several R/C manufacturers have introduced new lines of subminiature radio systems.
            The
            major breakthrough in this new generation of micro RIC equipment is the Dunham D5 servo mechanics and
            case
            which utilize a new 12 mm electric motor. As of this writing two manufacturers are actually producing
            these
            small radio systems, One is the Mathes Electronics Co of Lake Havasu City, Arizona (this system will be
            reviewed shortly in Flying Models). The other is the Cannon Super Mini system which has already been
            reviewed in the January 1977 issue of this magazine. In addition, assembled Dunham D5 servos can be
            purchased from Litco Systems, PO Box 90, East Hanover, New Jersey 07936. And if you are real ambitious
            you
            could even build your own D5 servo from a kit offered by D & D Electronic Specialists, PO Box 2102, Lake
            Havasu City, Arizona 86403. In the next year I predict even more R/C manufacturers will enter the
            subminiature field.</p>

        <p>What kind of radio system weight are we talking about? Well, for design purposes let's say a shade under
            4
            ounces for two channel digital proportional control using the new compact 100 mah batteries. The type of
            model airplane that can be designed around such a radio system offers many new advantages worth
            considering.
            Model engines .049 and smaller use very little fuel. Construction time may require only several nights
            instead of several months. The planes themselves involve very little material. For example, one roll of
            Super MonoKote or Solarfilm could cover a half dozen or more models of this size. The occasional crashes
            result in little damage which can easily be repaired. Flying fields can be reduced in size to the point
            where local school yard sized clear-ings or baseball fields will suffice. There is even the possibility
            of
            indoor R/C flying according to Ron Sheen in a recent RC Modeler article. Think of it, flying R/C in your
            shirt sleeves while there is snow outside on the ground.</p>
        <p>Of course there are also several disadvantages which must be considered. First of all the tiny airplanes
            do
            require some additional patience on the part of the builder, especially when it comes time to install
            the
            radio system. Also because of the small size these models can be a little difficult to fly, requiring
            some
            previous flying experience. Above all have your eyes checked. Your vision must be at its best to keep up
            with such small models.</p>
        <p>I personally think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Experience gained in the next year or so
            will
            even improve this situation. We are now just starting to hear about all kinds of new 1/2A R/C
            competition.
            Events such as 1/2A Stand-Off Scale, 1/2A Pattern, Quickie 200 and 100 racing and more. Competition is
            always the best stimulant.</p>
        <p>It was with all of this in mind that I decided to see just how small I could design and build a practical
            R/C
            model powered by the smallest commercially available engine, the Cox TD .010. I must admit I relied
            quite
            strongly on my experience gained last year with my little Cannonball (oz4406) which was powered by a Cox
            TD
            .020. The Cannonball had a 125 sq in wing and weighed approximately 12 ounces. To my surprise the Cox TD
            .010, using the standard 3 in diameter Cox prop, turns up close to 27,000 rpm. As such its power is
            roughly
            equal to 75% of that produced by the TD .020. Engine experts might dispute this with me but I'm going
            strictly by my experience.</p>
        <p>Since the TD .010 has so much power I decided to compromise the wing area at approximately 100 sq in for
            my
            new design. Some might have considered 60 to 70 sq in more appropriate. I felt the slightly larger area
            would provide for smoother performance. Remember, your flying enjoyment should also be considered. If
            your
            only criteria is to build small you could make your wingspan some ridiculous number, such as 7. But, you
            would be flying literally a controlled bomb.</p>
        <p>Another consideration was the wingspan. The Cannonball had a 22 in span and an aspect ratio (AR) of 3.83.
            It
            is still flying after 80 flights and two small crashes. However, I always felt that the aileron response
            was
            a little too sensitive around neutral. This causes the plane to appear a little jumpy or like it is
            constantly searching for a level attitude. A brief film prepared by Mr. George M Myers shows this
            characteristic of the Cannonball quite clearly. The film itself is still being circulated to various
            clubs
            throughout the country. To achieve a more comfortable feel I chose the same 22 in wing-span as the
            Cannonball, which now increases the AR to 4.8.</p>
        <p>Next most important item was my design weight. To keep the wing loading reasonable (around 13 oz/sq ft) I
            decided on a total weight of 9 ounces. This works out to 4 ounces for the model itself, 4 ounces for the
            radio-and finally 1/2 ounce for the TD .010 engine. I also figured on an additional growth factor of 1/2
            ounce to cover the foam rubber padding. My actual weight ready to fly came out to exactly 8.8 ounces
            which I
            felt was perfect after initial flight testing. In fact I have no doubt that the model would fly equally
            as
            well at a full 10 ounce total weight. As I pointed out in the Cannonball article, a 4 ounce model (bare
            weight) can still produce a very sound structure. I still employed spruce wing spars and some spruce
            reinforcement in the fuselage. I even used 1/32 plywood doublers on the inside of the fuselage. With all
            of
            this the finished structure came out a little under 4 ounces.</p>
        <p>Now let's talk about the configuration. I wouldn't be happy unless I did something different each time on
            a
            new design. As you must be aware by now I try to use all types of tail designs to create varied
            appearances.
            I had in mind for some time the possibility of using an inverted 'V' tail. Does an inverted V tail have
            any
            precedence in aircraft design? If you read the various full scale aircraft publications you know the
            answer
            is yes! Molt Taylor's Mini-Imp made the scene at the EAA shows several years ago. A three view and some
            photographs appeared on page 21 of the February 1976, Model Aviation. This plane has an inverted V tail
            and
            a rear mounted pusher prop. Professor Edgar Lesher designed the Teal experimental homebuilt which also
            utilizes this inverted tail. You can read about this plane in the Air Trails Homebuilt Aircraft, Summer
            1970, page 11 (photographs and three view). I even found reference to an old Free Flight design using
            this V
            type of tail, called the Kewpie. I found a photo of one in the February 1956, Model Airplane News, page
            13.

        <p>All of these references gave me certain confidence in the basic design approach. However, the final
            inspiration came from the AmEagle Corporation's American Eaglet powered glider. This full size plane was
            designed by Mr Larry Haig and was flown and displayed at the 1976 EAA Oshkosh Fly-In. I purchased an
            introductory data package for $3.00 (AmEagle Corp, 841 Winslow Court, Muskegon, Michigan 49441). The
            basic
            American Eaglet design employs a pod and boom fuselage. A small horsepower motor located at the rear of
            the
            pod powers this single place glider. The engine can be turned off in flight after gaining altitude. In
            this
            mode the propeller blades fold back into the airstream.</p>
        <p>My resulting design utilizes the basic pod with a semi-boom fuselage and an inverted V tail (as in the
            full
            size American Eaglet). For simplicity the model engine was placed up front on the nose. Because of the
            basic
            resemblance I called my model the Lil' Eaglet. In reality it is not even a Stand-Off Scale. This was not
            my
            intention. However, those truly interested in a scale powered glider project would do well to purchase
            the
            AmEagle data package.</p>
        <p>Construction. Start out by purchasing three basic sheets of balsa. Select a medium to slightly hard sheet
            of
            1/32 x4 x36. This will take care of all the wing sheeting..."</p>
