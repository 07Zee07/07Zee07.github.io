                    <li>1 red onion</li>
                    <li>100 g red lentils</li>
                    <li>1 aubergine</li>
                    <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
                    <li>15 g fresh root ginger</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
                    <li>5 g coriander</li>
                    <li>1 vegetable stock cube</li>
                    <li>1 coconut yoghurt pot (80 g)</li>
                    <li>1 can of green lentils (400 g)</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="method">
                <h4 class="title">Method</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7. Cut the aubergine[s] into quarters
                        lengthways, then slice into big pieces. Rub the chopped aubergine with a drizzle of olive
                        oil and the ground cumin, then season generously with salt</li>
                    <li>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high
                        heat. Once hot,
                        add the aubergine and cook for 1 min each side or until browned. Transfer the browned aubergine
                        to a baking
                        tray (use tin foil to avoid mess) and put it in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through
                        (reserve the
                        pan for later!) - this is your spiced aubergine</li>
                    <li>While the aubergine is cooking, boil a kettle. Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic. Peel
                        the
                        ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate). Peel and dice the red
                        onion[s]</li>
                    <li>Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Once hot, add the diced onion with
                        a pinch
                        of salt. Cook for 5 min or until softened. Add the chopped ginger and garlic and the curry
                        powder and
                        cook for a further 3 min</li>
                    <li>Rinse the red lentils in a sieve under the cold tap. Add the red lentils and canned lentils (no
                        need to drain)
                        to the softened onion. Dissolve the vegetable stock cube[s] in 350 ml [550 ml] boiled water. Add
                        the stock to
                        the lentils and stir for 10-15 min or until all the water is absorbed and the lentils are tender
                        and porridge-like
                        in consistency</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks.</li>
                    <li>Once the lentils are cooked, remove them from the heat and stir in 2/3 of the coconut yoghurt
                        and 2/3 of the chopped
                        coriander (you'll use the rest for garnish) – this is your two-lentil dal. Season generously
                        with salt and pepper.
                        Serve the two-lentil dal in bowls and top with the spiced aubergine. Garnish with the remaining
                        chopped coriander
                        and a dollop of the remaining coconut yoghurt</li>

                    <li>Peel and finely dice the red onion. Cut the cauliflower into small florets. Heat a large,
                        wide-based pan
                        (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with 2 tbsp vegetable oil over a high heat.</li>
                    <li>Once the pan is hot, add the diced onion, cauliflower, curry powder and a pinch of salt and
                        pepper. Cook for
                        5 min or until starting to soften.</li>
                    <li>Crumble the vegetable stock cube into the pan and add the tomato paste. Tip: Add a drizzle of
                        oil if the pan
                        looks a little dry</li>
                    <li>Cook for a further 2 min or until the cauliflower is starting to colour. Transfer the contents
                        of the pan to a
                        bowl and set aside (reserve the pan for later) – this is your cauliflower mixture</li>
                    <li>Return the reserved pan to a high heat, add the basmati rice and stir to coat the grains in the
                        remaining oil.
                        Add 350ml water and bring to the boil over a high heat. Meanwhile, cut the green beans in half.
                    </li>
                    <li>Return the cauliflower mixture back to the pan. Add the green beans and sultanas.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered for 10-12 min or until the water has absorbed
                        and the rice is
                        cooked – this is your vegetable biryani. Tip: Add a little water if the rice is not cooked or
                        the mixture is
                        looking a little dry. Meanwhile, chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks.</li>
                    <li>Check that the rice is tender, then taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed.
                        Serve the vegetable
                        biryani with a dollop of coconut yoghurt and garnish with the chopped coriander.</li>

                    <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7. Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably
                        non-stick) with

                    <li>Add the ripped focaccia to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Put

                    <li>Meanwhile, crumble the chestnut mushrooms into the pan. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper
                        and cook for 5 min
                        or until golden and softened – these are your caramelised mushrooms. Tip: Try not to stir the
                        mushrooms too often,
                        as this will stop them from caramelising!</li>

                    <li>Combine the chopped basil with the Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, 3 tbsp olive oil and 2
                        tbsp cold water. Season
                        with a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar and stir it all together – this is your basil dressing

                    <li>Preheat the grill to a high heat, then boil a kettle. Rip the portobello and chestnut mushrooms into bite-sized 
                        pieces onto a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil then season generously with salt and pepper. Put the tray directly 
                        under the grill and cook for 12-15 min or until they're nicely caramelised</li>
                    <li>Add the 3 seed mix to a large pot over a high heat and cook for 1-2 min or until toasted. Once toasted, set aside on

                    <li>Return the pot to a high heat. Add the linguine with plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil 
                        over a high heat and cook for 8-12 min or until cooked with a slight bite. Once cooked, drain and reserve a cup of 
                        the starchy cooking water</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic. Chop the basil finely, including the stalks. Grate the cheddar 
                        cheese finely </li>
                    <li>Grind the chopped basil, chopped garlic and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a smooth paste. Add 2-3 tbsp 
                        olive oil and mix well. Tip: if you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop the basil very finely, then mix with olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Add the grated cheese to the basil with 2-3 tbsp olive oil. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix 
                        thoroughly – this is your pesto</li>
                    <li>Return the drained linguine to the pot with a splash of your reserved starchy cooking water. Stir the pesto and half 
                        of the caramelised mushrooms through and cook for 1 min or until the pesto has coated the pasta and the cheese has 
                        melted. Top with the remaining caramelised mushrooms</li>
