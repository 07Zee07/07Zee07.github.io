            <h2>CUB</h2>
            <h3>About this plan</h3>
            <div class="project-txt">
                <p>I bought this plane from a club friend. This is a 20+ years old scale model. It has a Zenoah 23cc
                    petrol engine.</p>
                <p>As soon as I got the plane, I performed a test flight and it flew really well, it was a very
                    realistic experience in all. But the plane was looking old and tatty so I have decided it deserves a
                    thorough refurbishment. Due to it's size (2.5m wingspan) I knew it will be a lot of work. All the
                    covers needed to be replaced. Since the windows have been cracked, they would have to go as well.
                    The engine needs a full clean. Some servos replaced and the structure needs to be reinforced.</p>
                <p>Step 1:<br>Remove the old covering material. I have used my bare hands, a hobby knife and some
                    sanding paper. All the glue had to be removed entirely.</p>
                <p>Step 2:<br>Structural repairs and reinforcement: due to the age of the plane on some parts the glue
                    has hardened and snapped, so there were loose parts. I needed to remove said loose bits and insert
                    fresh balsa with Epoxy glue and CA.</p>
                <p>Step 3:<br>Sand it all to silky smoothness...</p>
                <p>Step 4:<br>The new cover. I decided to use nylon with shrinking Dope, because this was the original
                    technique used on the plane when it was built. These materials are old school but easy enough to get
                    from eBay. Since I don't have the plans for the plane, I had to roughly cut pieces of the nylon with
                    a sharp scissor and reshape them a little before glueing. Using a small brush I applied Dope on the
                    edges of the structure, laid the nylon on top, traced the edges with the brush, pulled out the
                    wrinkles and spread Dope evenly on the whole surface of the nylon. The Dope acts as a glue and also
                    will stretch and harden the nylon giving the impression of plastic once it has dried. This is a slow
                    process and needs a well ventilated area, as the Dope whilst drying expels some unpleasant fumes.
                </p>
                <p>Step 5:<br>The new windows are made from clear PETG plastic sheet. The dimensions I've got by tracing
                    the old windows.</p>
                <p>~ to be continued ~</p>

            <h2>RIPMAX 40</h2>
            <h3>About this plan</h3>
            <div class="project-txt">
                <p>This is a RIPMAX 40 trainer plane. 1.55m wingspan, weight: 2200g, engine: two-stroke 38-48.</p>
                <p>This plane was a gift from one of club friends. The plane came without engine but in overall good
                    condition. Since the plane came with all the servos working I only had to install a receiver,
                    battery and an engine.</p>
                <p>The installed receiver is a HiTEC 6 channels Optima model (but we only need 4 for this plane).</p>
                <p>The battery is a 6V 2500mAh Ni-MH rechargeable.</p>
                <p>I had lying around an Irvine 61 glow engine, which might be a tad big, but the extra power would
                    serve well as I wanted to use this as a towing plane. The overall performance was quite impressive
                    due to the extra power.</p>
                <p>On the wings I had to make some repairs on the cover, but I decided to just patch over, to keep the
                    character of the plane.</p>
                <p>With this setup I added an excellent, powerful plane to my collection.</p>

            <h2>The Motor Glider</h2>
            <h3>About this plan</h3>
            <div class="project-txt">
                <p>Since I have a small collection of tiny engines (COX 0.49), I decided to build a motor glider.</p>
                <p>These engines work only for a few minutes at full power (depending on which one I use it could be 1
                    to 2,5 minutes average), I realised it would be a perfect thing for a two channel glider. The idea
                    is to take off and use the engine to go as high as possible, and when the engine dies, glide it down
                    or catch a thermal and glide even longer.</p>
                <p>I decided to build the plane using mainly balsa with a simple square fuselage and a carbon rod tube
                    to hold the tale. The wing is a symmetric shape with a good diahedral to keep the plane stable and
                    easy to maneuver only using the rudder.</p>
                <p>I covered the wings with solar film.</p>
                <p>For the electronics I used 2 x 9g servos, a mini receiver and a very small 3.7V 300mAh battery. With
                    the battery I had to use a DC to DC step up voltage. The battery supplies 3.7V and the receiver
                    needs a minimum of 5V.</p>
                <p>The plane is a great success due to its lightweight (275g) and structure making a good gliding ratio.
